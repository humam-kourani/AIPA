First, the implements are prepared, the hands are washed, and the doctor gets in sterile clothes. The doctor cleans the puncture area, and drapes the puncture zone. The doctor configures the ultrasound, and puts gel in the probe. Then, the doctor covers the probe and puts the sterile gel. The doctor positions the probe and positions the patient. The vein is identified using an anatomic identification, a doppler identification, or a compression identification. The patient is anesthetize and punctured. The blood return is checked. If the blood return is not correct, the doctor goes back to the puncture step. If the blood return is correct, the probe is dropped and the syringe is removed. The guidewire is installed, and the trocar is removed. Then the wire is checked using a check of the wire in the long axis, or a check of the wire in the short axis. Then, the doctor checks if the wire is in good position. If the wire is not in the good position, the doctor goes back to the puncture step. If the wire is in the good position, the pathway is widen, the catheter is advanced, and the guirewire is removed. Finally, the doctor verifies the flow and the reflow, and the catheter position is checked.
