The process starts with the sales team checking the newly arrived customers order every Monday morning. The check of the customer’s order includes several steps. First, the customer’s order is checked for completeness. Second, the sales team checks whether the customer is already in the database. If the customer is not in the database, he is added to the database. If the customer is already in the database, the process proceeds without further activities. 
Next, the sales team sends the order details to the production as well as to the procurement. As soon as the order details arrive, the production team starts to plan the production. Simultaneously, it waits for the message that the material is not faulty from the procurement to arrive. Once, the message from the procurement has arrived and the production has been planned, the product is manufactured. After that, the product is given to the warehouse.
When the order details arrive at the procurement team, orders the necessary material for the production. After that, they check the materials. If the materials are faulty, a compensation event is triggered, and the order is cancelled. The materials are returned, and the process ends at this step. If the materials are not faulty, a message is sent to the production.
When the warehouse receives the product from the production, they send the product to the customer. After that, they send a message to the sales team that the product was sent.
When the sales team receives the message that the product is sent, they draft the invoice. After that the process is finished.
