In BPMN 2.0, compensation often involves a subprocess because compensation activities can be complex and involve multiple steps that need to be executed in sequence to effectively "undo" or counteract the effects of the original activities. Compensation activities can involve multiple actions that need to be performed in a specific order to properly reverse the effects of a completed activity. Using a subprocess allows these steps to be grouped together and managed as a single unit.
