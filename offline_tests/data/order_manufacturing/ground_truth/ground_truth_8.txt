Compensations are based on the fact that in a process sometimes tasks are executed that must be undone later under certain conditions. Compensations make it possible to unwind tasks that have already been completed. A compensation can be triggered, for example, by errors that occur later in the process flow. A compensation includes a throwing compensation event and a catching compensation event. The throwing event triggers a compensation subprocess. The catching event triggers cancelation activities.
