Every Monday morning, the customers’ orders are checked. Checking the customers’ order includes checking the order for completeness and after that checking if the customer is already in the database. If the customer is not in the database, the customer is added to the database and the subprocess ends. If the customer is already in the database, the subprocess for checking the customer’s order ends. After checking the customer’s order, the order details are send to the production and to the procurement. Then, the sales team waits for the message that the product is sent. After the product is sent, they draft the invoice and the process is finished.
