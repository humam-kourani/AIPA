After the order details are sent to the procurement team, the procurement team orders the materials. After the materials have arrived, the procurement team checks the materials. If an error occurs, e.g., the material is faulty, the order is cancelled, a compensation is triggered and the materials are returned. The process ends after the compensation. If no error occurs, a message is sent to the production that the material is not faulty whereby the process also ends for the procurement team.
