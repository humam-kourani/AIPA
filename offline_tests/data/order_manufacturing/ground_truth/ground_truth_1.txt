After the order details arrive, the procurement team orders the materials for the production. After that, they check the materials. If an error occurs during the checking of the materials (e.g., the material is faulty), a compensation is initiated and the order is cancelled. The materials are returned. If the model is not faulty, a message is sent to the production team and the process ends at this point for the production team.
