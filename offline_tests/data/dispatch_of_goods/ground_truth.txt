The process starts with the secretary clarifying the shipment method and the warehouse simultaneously packaging the goods. If the warehouse has not finished packaging the goods after 48 hours, the customer is informed about the delay. After the secretary has clarifies the shipment method, it checks whether special handling is needed. If special handling is needed, the secretary gets three offers from logistic companies and then selects the logistic company and places the order. If no special handling is needed, the secretary checks if insurance is required based on the order details and the customer information from the database. After the secretary has checked if insurance is required, it always has to write the package label. If insurance is required, the logistics insures the parcel. When the warehouse has finished packaging the goods, it fills out the shipment paperwork and moves the package to the pickup area. After that the shipment is prepared and the process is finished.
