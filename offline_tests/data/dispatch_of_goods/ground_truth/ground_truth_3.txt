The secretary clarifies the shipment method. Then, if shipment requires special handling, he/she gets an offer from 3 logistic companies, selects one and places an order. If, however, shipment does not require special handling, the secretary checks if extra insurance is required based on the order details and the customer information from the database and writes the package label.
