The gateway after the activity "clarify shipment method" is an exclusive-or gateway and routes the process to one of the outgoing sequence paths. In this case, it moves the process on to the activity "get 3 offers from logistic companies" if shipment requires special handling. If shipment does not require special handling, it moves the process on to the activity "check if insurance is required".
