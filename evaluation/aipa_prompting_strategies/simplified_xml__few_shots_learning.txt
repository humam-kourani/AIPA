- These are example pairs of input and expected output:
Input 0: How does the bank start the credit scoring process?
Expected output 0: A bank clerk uses their software to request a credit score for a customer, which kicks off the process in the banking system to communicate with the credit protection agency.
Input 1: What happens after the bank sends a scoring request to the agency?
Expected output 1: The agency performs an initial credit scoring, and if this initial scoring is successful, the result is sent back immediately to the bank's system and shown to the clerk.
Input 2: What occurs if the initial credit scoring doesn’t give an immediate result?
Expected output 2: The agency informs the bank's system about the delay and starts a more detailed scoring. The bank's system then sends a notification to the clerk to report the delay.
Input 3: How is the clerk informed of the final credit scoring result?
Expected output 3: Once the scoring is completed and the result is sent back to the bank's system, it is sent to the clerk's software.
Input 4: What does the bank do if the credit score is delayed?
Expected output 4: The bank's system sends a notification to the clerk to report the delay, and as soon as the final score is ready, it sends the results to the clerk.
